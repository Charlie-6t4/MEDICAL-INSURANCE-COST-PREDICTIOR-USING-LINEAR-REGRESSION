# MEDICAL-INSURANCE-COST-PREDICTIOR-USING-LINEAR-REGRESSION
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs using a linear regression model. By analyzing various factors such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region, we aim to estimate the insurance costs for individuals.

# **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is the Medical Cost Personal Datasets obtained from Kaggle. It contains information about individuals including their age, sex, BMI, children, smoking habits, region, and medical costs.

# **Methodology**
**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

**Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features that impact insurance costs.

**Model Building:** Using linear regression to build the predictive model.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model using metrics such as R-squared score.

# **Dependencies**
Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn 

# **Results**
The trained model achieves a certain level of accuracy in predicting medical insurance costs based on the input features. The project provides insights into the factors affecting insurance costs and demonstrates the use of linear regression for predictive modeling in the healthcare domain.

# **Future Improvements**
Exploring other regression algorithms for potentially better performance.

Incorporating more features or external datasets for improved predictions.

Deploying the model as a web application or API for real-time predictions.
